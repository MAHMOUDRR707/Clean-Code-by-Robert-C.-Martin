# Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

Notes for â€œClean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"

In this repo you can find my notes for Clean Code as I read through it. This is primarily to act as a learning tool and reference for me but I hope others will find it beneficial as well. Other repos that were trying to do this were not organized well and had either too much or too little information. Here I will list the handfull of notes I think most important for each section.
